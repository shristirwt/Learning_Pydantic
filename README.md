# Learning Pydantic üöÄ

> A collection of simple, well-documented code snippets exploring core Pydantic concepts.

## About This Repository

This repository is a showcase of my learnings in Pydantic. Each Python file focuses on a specific feature (like `field_validator`, `model_validator`, `Nested Models`, etc.) and includes line-by-line comments to explain the implementation. The goal is to create a clear and easy-to-understand reference for anyone learning Pydantic.

## Topics Covered

* What is Pydantic and Why it is used
* Basic Model Creation
* Type Hinting and Coercion
* Field Validation (`field_validator`)
* Model Validation (`model_validator`)
* Nested Models
* Data Serialization (e.g., `model_dump`, `model_dump_json`)
